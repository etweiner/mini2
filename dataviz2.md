In this visualization, I used a radial dial to display the information of the amount of government debt between the different countries around the world. When the data was initially presented in this visual, there were lines coming out of the center of the dial, connecting to each country. I decided to take these out because it made the graphic too busy and I wanted to limit eye travel. I put the countries with the largest amount of debt on the left hand side of the graph so viewers can read the dial from left to right, in a clockwise direction. I rotated the dial to begin on the left hand side of the page because it seemed as though it was the best way to limit eye travel as the countries move from biggest to smallest amount of debt. I also limited the dial to one color because if I assigned different colors to each country, that would be way too distracting. I used a darker purple color so the bars coming out of the dial stand out against the white background. When designing this visualization, lighter colors, such as gray, looked too washed out. Additionally, I kept the numbers which show the amount of government debt for each country and added a header and subheader to put some context into the graphic. 

This visual aligns more closely with the bar chart from the first visualization because it portrays the data in a grouping of bars, just one is along an x and y-axis and the other is around a circle. I think both of these allow for an easier way to read the data where as the grid of line charts makes it hard to compare the countries and their debt from one another since you are looking at multiple different line charts at the same time.
