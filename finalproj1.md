## Final Project Proposal --change to national park? how has visitation changed pre, during and post covid? especially with the use of the outdoors being better?

### Topic and Summary: The Impact of Covid on US National Parks
As a national park enthusiast, I am always curious about the innerworkings of the National Park System and the parks themselves. There are approximately 423 national parks that cover over 84 million acres in the United States.^1 The nation parks are immensly popular tourist destinations as in 2021, the national parks were visited by 297.1 million visitors.^2 Because the national parks are so vast, the National Park Services employs 20,000 employees in order to keep each park open and running. Prior to the onset of Covid19, the national parks saw slews of visitors each month. With the start of the March 202 lockdown, visitation plummeted^3 as everyone sheltered in place. With the shutdown and aftermath, the national parks were affected.
