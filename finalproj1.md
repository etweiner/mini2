## Final Project Proposal

### Topic: I Love to Swim
As a child, I spent every day in every summer swimming in the various lakes of Wisconsin, or in the pool that my mom swam in as a child. I don't remember even taking lessons, that's how inate swimming was for me. As an adult, I find myself in the pool on a regular basis, swimming laps for exercise and as a way to burn off stress. 
In thinking about this final project, I realized that I don't even think about my ability to swim and I take it for granted as there are many adults who cannot swim. Over the summer, I was hanging out with some friends paddle boarding when one of the girls states that she doesn't know how to swim. This person was also sitting on a paddle board in deep water, without a life jacket. After she mentioned she couldn't swim, I began to think that if she happened to fall off and into the water, there would be no way to save her. Nobody in the group was a trained lifeguard and once panic kicks in, it is all over. That moment really changed my outlook on swimming.
For this final project, I intend to explore the topic of the number of Americans who do not know how to swim and the contributing factors. I will also look into the factors associated with accidental drownings in adults and whether or not knowing how to swim had an impact. 
With this topic, I want to tell a story of the number of adult Americans who do not know how to swim and why. I want to show this over a certain time period while also displaying the contributing factors that play into an inability to swim in adults. 

### Story Arc
