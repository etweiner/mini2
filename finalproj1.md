# Final Project Proposal --change to national park? how has visitation changed pre, during and post covid? especially with the use of the outdoors being better?

## Outline
### Topic: The Impact of Covid on US National Parks
As a national park enthusiast, I am always planning my next trip to some of American's most beloved treasures. It always astounds me just how much beauty this country holds. In thinking about the final project, I wanted to continue researching the national parks as there are approximately 423 national parks that cover over 84 million acres in the United States.^1 The national parks remain an immensly popular tourist destinations as in 2021, the national parks were visited by 297.1 million visitors.^2 Because the national parks are so vast, the National Park Services employs 20,000 employees in order to keep each park open and running. I was unaware of just how much work it takes to maintain the parks and keep the parks open for visitors. Prior to the onset of Covid19, the national parks saw slews of visitors each month. With the start of the March 2020 lockdown, visitation plummeted^3 as everyone sheltered in place. In the previous homework assignment, I looked into the number of National Park visitors over the course of four years from 2018-2021, in which while the visitation numbers were up in 2021, they still were not at the same levels as prior to Covid. Because of this, I was curious as to the impacts on the US NAtional Parks. 

In my final project, I plan to show and explore the various impacts of Covid on the US National Parks, both positive and negative. After completing some initial research, there are very evident impacts on the number of visitors^4, NPS employment, educational programs, etc.^5 I also plan to explore and show the environmental impacts on the National Parks due to Covid. 

### Project Structure
**Problem:** The US National Parks were greatly impacted by the Covid19 pandemic. 
**Begining:** Look at what the national parks were like before the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the US National Parks saw  x number of visitors each year, held x amount of programs, employed x amount of employees, conducted x amount of research, and there was x amount of convservation efforts. 
**During:** The National Parks shut down, shortage of staffing, educational programming paused, conservation efforts paused, visitation dropped off, 
**After:** Parks implemented reservation system for crowd control, educational programming resumed,^6 visitation picked back up again with people new to the outdoors, creating problems like overcrowding, lack of entry and vandalism^7. On a positive note, renewed appreciation among Americans for the National Parks.
  
#### Story Arc
**Set up:** Person travels to a national park for vacation during peak summer season.

**Conflict:** National Park parking lot is full upon arrival. Cannot gain entry and reservations are all sold out. Vacation is ruined. 

**Resolution:** Returns to national park in a different season and there are plenty of parking spaces available. 

**What I hope to achieve:** I hope to show that while many people turned to the national parks as a refuge and source of adventure, hope and freedom from quarantine during and after the pandemic, the US National Parks were still greatly affected by Covid and while these parks have been established for years, they are still fragile ecosystems that can suffer due to human behavior and issues like a global pandemic.
