It wasn't until I was in college that I went to my first National Park in the United States. I visited Rocky Mountain National Park and was blown away by its sheer beauty; the sprawling mountains, glacial lakes and Aspen trees. Coming from the Midwest, I couldn't believe that this type of georgraphy was in our country. Throughout college and even after, I have visited many National Parks as it is one of my top vacation choices. National Parks are scattered all throughout the United States, from the East Coast to the West. With the exception of the pandemic, each time I have visited a National Park, they were always packed with people, since they are popular travel destinations. When looking for a visualization to critique, I was interested in looking at the visitation rates of US National Parks and if/how they have changed throughout the years. I first searched for yearly visitation rates but soon found that a lot of data was broken up by each month. I thought that it was an interesting way to compare and contrast the amount of visitors to each park. I then came across this visual from Scientific Reports, labled "Visitor Count to All National Parks 2018-2021." I looked at it and thought it was an interesting way to display the data, through a series of line graphs. 
I then looked closer and thought that this was a poorly designed visual and thought it would be an excellent candidate to redo. I was immediately drawn to the amount of visitors before the pandemic and how once March 2020 hit, the number of visitors completely dropped off (no surprise). I then found it interesting that in 2021, the Parks have since not recovered the number of visitors it had once seen before the pandemic in 2018-2019. I wanted to explore this more and create a better visual that clearly shows the yearly comparisions of the data. 

## Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile
Before I even began the written component of the critique, I thought about how this particular visual was not working the best: There are too many colors which make the visual seem a little chaotic. Additionally, the background isn't a solid color which involves too much eye movement around the screen and the colors are quite transparent making it difficult to determine which years they are associated with. I also noticed that the purple line of the year 2021 completely disappeared. I didn't understand why the line just stopped without any explanation, which didn't make any sense. I also felt as though the header/title was not big enough and there were facts about the Pandemic that seem to be important, but they are labeled vertically along the y-axis making it quite difficult to read since you have to tilt your head sideways. I thought this was an odd way to display additional information. 

Using the Google form to critique this visualization allowed me to think about it more in depth than just superficially. I ranked the visual as a 5 for usefulness, as even though it is not great to look at, it still communicates the information of National Park visitors in the years 2018-2021 per month. I could tell which months and years had higher visitation rates than others. For completeness, I ranked teh visual as a 3 as the purple line of the graph (for the year 2021) stopped at April of 2021. I felt as though not continuing through the whole year of 2021 was incomplete. For perceptibility, I gave the visual a 5, as while I can read it and understand it, the visual did cause me to take a closer look as I examined the dates and text along the y-axis. I also felt as though a line graph is approrpriate, there are better options to display the data. For truthfulness, I gave the visual a 1. When I was looking at the graph, the nunbers along the y-axis (which represents the number of people) seemed pretty small. I then tried to look up the data that the article used to get these numbers only to find that I would have to pay to view the original article where thedata is housed. I then looked on the National Parks website and obtained the data in which the numbers are vastly bigger than those represented on this visual. 
For intuitiveness, I ranked the visual as a 6 since I could understand the gist of what the data is representing, how the National Parks saw much greater visitation in the years prior to Covid and then the visitiation dropped off basically at March 2020. It did seem some-what easy to understand if I could take away the extra distractions of color and text. For the aesthetic portion, I ranked a 3 as the graph was not totally ugly, but ugly enough that it deserved to be redone. I thought the colors clashed and the transparency between them made different colors when the lines overlapped each other. I also thought the background was too busy, which caused my eye to look in all different directions. 
Lastly, for engagement, I ranked the visual as a 4 because while I did get the idea of what the data is saying, the only thing I was curious about was why the visual did not include all 12 months of data for the year 2021. I was curious to see if visitation started to pick back up again after 2020. 


## Sketching Out a Solution
Before I even went to pencil and paper, I already thougtht that I woudld like to see the data displayed in a bar graph. With a bar graph, viewers can easily compare and constrast the data presented and it also seemed logical since I am comparing the months of certain years to the amount of people. I chose to sketch out three different options of bar graphs as I wasn't quite sure which one would be best to display the data. 

### Sketch 1
In the first sketch, I put the months along the x-axis and amount of people along the y-axis. I then grouped the bars for the four years of 2018-2021 and color coded them to show distinction. I made my sketch too big to fit on the page and could only fit eight months, but I think the idea is still there.

### Sketch 2
I was trying to play around with the best option to display the data while making the visual intuitive, communicative, visually appealing etc. In this sketch, I decided to group the graphs by each month, which each year along the x-axis. This created a total of 12 graphs. I also took out the color since there was so many graphs, I did not want to create any more chaos. After sketching these out, I immediately knew that there was too much on the page and viewers would not know what to look at first. The information would not be intuitive enough as viewers would have to look at each grpah in order to see the comparison, causing your eye to search all over the page.

### Sketch #3
In this graph, I decided to group the data by year, for a total of 12 graphs. I sketched the number of months along the x-axis and soon realized that by creating the visual in this manner, it was a great way to display the monthly data of each year. However, that is not quite the story that the graphs are supposed to represent. I also kept the visual colorless in order to eliminate business.

## Testing My Solutions

I showed each of my visuals to two separate individuals- an adult in his late 50s and student in her early 20s. Each person agreed that sketch 1 (the colored visual) was the easiest to compare and contrast the data. The adult explained that he could easily tell that the visitation numbers following 2020 were not up to the mass numbers pre-covid. He also explained that all the information is in one spot, versus many other graphs on one page. This adult also explained that he could tell the data could be utilized by the National Park Service (NPS) themselves to analyze why the numbers have not gotten back up to pre-covid, theorizing that the NPS may have been going through staffing shortages and simply could not handle the amount of people. The adult also mentioned that this visual could be used by anyone who wants to travel to the National Parks in order to determine the least busy times to go. 

The student brought up some interesting points. I asked her if she could tell what the visual was saying, and she could easily read that amount of people per month that visited US National Parks. I also asked if she knew the intended audience from the sketch and she assumed for the National Park Service audience or avid National Park travelers. I also asked for suggestions in which she said not labeling the axis was confusing and also include a better header. Finally, she mentioned that sketch 1 worked the best, in her opinion, because it makes more sense to have all the data on the same visual rather than having multiple. 

## Building My Solution

### First Draft

Since both of the critiques mentioned that they liked sketch 1 the best, I went ahead and created a visual that looked like the sketch. I incorporated the student's feedback and added axis labels and made sure the header/title was readable. I wanted to show the impact Covid had on visitors to the National Parks compared to non-Covid years, but still having the ability to see the amount of visitors each month over the course of the four years. I thought that would be a communicative way to display the downward trend of visitors. 


However, when after I created the visual (as seen above), I noticed that it looked as though the bars were quite squished along the x-axis, the width of the bars were too thin, and there was too much color. While I wanted to show the impact Covid had on visitors to the National Parks compared to non-Covid years, I was just not sure this graph effectively displayed that. 

### Second Draft
Since I felt as though my first draft of the visual did not work effectively, I decided to incorporate some of my own feedback that I described above. I eliminated the majority of the colors and left the years of 2018, 2019 and 2021 in gray with the year 2020 in red. I wanted to emphasize just how great Covid impacted the average daily visitiation to the National Parks (see below).

I decided to ask for some more feedback on this visual to understand a better idea of what I should change. I asked an adult in her early 60s, who said it is "squished a bit, but the data compares each month of each year side by side, all four years together. You can easily see the trends. But it is busy."

I gathered from this feedback that this particular iteration of the visual was not as intuitive as it could be. While it does communicate the message (Covid affecting the number of visitors to national parks), it could be done so more effecively. 


### Third Draft 

After studying my second draft of the visual, I still felt as though there was too much in the visual. I could not eliminate any months because that would detract from the overall story of how Covid impacted every month after its emergence, so I decided to change the grouping of the bars into years so that all of the data would still be shown, but the visual would not look as squished (see below). I wanted to play around with the color to see if it added or detracted anything from the story so I decided to make the starting year of the data (2018) blue.

I also asked for feedback on this draft of the visual in comparision with the second draft. Three Heinz students mentioned that they liked how the third visual was organized and the same adult said that "you can quickly see that visitation during the Covid year was down but recovered the next year to near pre-Covid levels. Harder to see with the first graph." I understood from this feedback that by re-grouping the data in the graph, I could easily tell the story. I also gathered that my third draft allowed for more perceptibility, intuitiveness and it was more communicative and visually pleasing since it was easier to visualize the trends, based on the various feedback I had recieved.  

I went back to the third draft visual and decided that I do not need to emphasize the data in year 2018 as it does not add anything to the meaning of the visual. I decided to place that year in gray so it will also stand out against 2020, or the year of Covid. 


## Final Visualization

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11806281"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This redesigned data visualization tells a story of how the US National Parks were impacted by Covid19. As shown in the early years of 2018 and 2019, the Parks were hugely popular, especially in the warmer months. Once the onset of Covid began in January 2020, visitorship plummeted for every month compared to the previous years. Visitors to the National Parks began to bounce back in 2021, however, the numbers were still not quite as high as those pre-Covid, which could be for a number of reasons: NPS may have had a staffing shortage or many people still were not traveling due to the risk of Covid. At any rate, like many other parts of the country and world, Covid's impact is still quite vast.
