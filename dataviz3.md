It wasn't until I was in college that I went to my first National Park in the United States. I visited Rocky Mountain National Park and was blown away by its sheer beauty; the sprawling mountains, glacial lakes and Aspen trees. Coming from the Midwest, I couldn't believe that this type of georgraphy was in our country. Throughout college and even after, I have visited many National Parks as it is one of my top vacation choices. National Parks are scattered all throughout the United States, from the East Coast to the West. With the exception of the pandemic, each time I have visited a National Park, they were always packed with people, since they are popular travel destinations. When looking for a visualization to critique, I was interested in looking at the visitation rates of US National Parks and if/how they have changed throughout the years. I first searched for yearly visitation rates but soon found that a lot of data was broken up by each month. I thought that it was an interesting way to compare and contrast the amount of visitors to each park. I then came across this visual from Scientific Reports, labled "Visitor Count to All National Parks 2018-2021." I looked at it and thought it was an interesting way to display the data, through a series of line graphs. 
I then looked closer and thought that this was a poorly designed visual and thought it would be an excellent candidate to redo. I was immediately drawn to the amount of visitors before the pandemic and how once March 2020 hit, the number of visitors completely dropped off (no surprise). I then found it interesting that in 2021, the Parks have since not recovered the number of visitors it had once seen before the pandemic in 2018-2019. I wanted to explore this more and create a better visual that clearly shows the yearly comparisions of the data.

Before I even began the written component of the critique, I thought about how this particular visual was not working the best: There are too many colors which make the visual seem a little chaotic. Additionally, the background isn't a solid color which involves too much eye movement around the screen and the colors are quite transparent making it difficult to determine which years they are associated with. I also noticed that the purple line of the year 2021 completely disappeared. I didn't understand why the line just stopped without any explanation, which didn't make any sense. I also felt as though the header/title was not big enough and there were facts about the Pandemic that seem to be important, but they are labeled vertically along the y-axis making it quite difficult to read since you have to tilt your head sideways. I thought this was an odd way to display additional information.
