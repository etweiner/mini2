It wasn't until I was in college that I went to my first National Park in the United States. I visited Rocky Mountain National Park and was blown away by its sheer beauty; the sprawling mountains, glacial lakes and Aspen trees. Coming from the Midwest, I couldn't believe that this type of georgraphy was in our country. Throughout college and even after, I have visited many National Parks as it is one of my top vacation choices. National Parks are scattered all throughout the United States, from the East Coast to the West. With the exception of the pandemic, each time I have visited a National Park, they were always packed with people, since they are popular travel destinations. When looking for a visualization to critique, I was interested in looking at the visitation rates of US National Parks and if/how they have changed throughout the years. I first searched for yearly visitation rates but soon found that a lot of data was broken up by each month. I thought that it was an interesting way to compare and contrast the amount of visitors to each park. I then came across this visual from Scientific Reports, labled "Visitor Count to All National Parks 2018-2021." I looked at it and thought it was an interesting way to display the data, through a series of line graphs. 
I then looked closer and thought that this was a poorly designed visual and thought it would be an excellent candidate to redo. I was immediately drawn to the amount of visitors before the pandemic and how once March 2020 hit, the number of visitors completely dropped off (no surprise). I then found it interesting that in 2021, the Parks have since not recovered the number of visitors it had once seen before the pandemic in 2018-2019. I wanted to explore this more and create a better visual that clearly shows the yearly comparisions of the data. 

## Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile
Before I even began the written component of the critique, I thought about how this particular visual was not working the best: There are too many colors which make the visual seem a little chaotic. Additionally, the background isn't a solid color which involves too much eye movement around the screen and the colors are quite transparent making it difficult to determine which years they are associated with. I also noticed that the purple line of the year 2021 completely disappeared. I didn't understand why the line just stopped without any explanation, which didn't make any sense. I also felt as though the header/title was not big enough and there were facts about the Pandemic that seem to be important, but they are labeled vertically along the y-axis making it quite difficult to read since you have to tilt your head sideways. I thought this was an odd way to display additional information. 

Using the Google form to critique this visualization allowed me to think about it more in depth than just superficially. I ranked the visual as a 5 for usefulness, as even though it is not great to look at, it still communicates the information of National Park visitors in the years 2018-2021 per month. I could tell which months and years had higher visitation rates than others. For completeness, I ranked teh visual as a 3 as the purple line of the graph (for the year 2021) stopped at April of 2021. I felt as though not continuing through the whole year of 2021 was incomplete. For perceptibility, I gave the visual a 5, as while I can read it and understand it, the visual did cause me to take a closer look as I examined the dates and text along the y-axis. I also felt as though a line graph is approrpriate, there are better options to display the data. For truthfulness, I gave the visual a 1. When I was looking at the graph, the nunbers along the y-axis (which represents the number of people) seemed pretty small. I then tried to look up the data that the article used to get these numbers only to find that I would have to pay to view the original article where thedata is housed. I then looked on the National Parks website and obtained the data in which the numbers are vastly bigger than those represented on this visual. 
For intuitiveness, I ranked the visual as a 6 since I could understand the gist of what the data is representing, how the National Parks saw much greater visitation in the years prior to Covid and then the visitiation dropped off basically at March 2020. It did seem some-what easy to understand if I could take away the extra distractions of color and text. For the aesthetic portion, I ranked a 3 as the graph was not totally ugly, but ugly enough that it deserved to be redone. I thought the colors clashed and the transparency between them made different colors when the lines overlapped each other. I also thought the background was too busy, which caused my eye to look in all different directions. 
Lastly, for engagement, I ranked the visual as a 4 because while I did get the idea of what the data is saying, the only thing I was curious about was why the visual did not include all 12 months of data for the year 2021. I was curious to see if visitation started to pick back up again after 2020. 


## Sketching Out a Solution
Before I even went to pencil and paper, I already thougtht that I woudld like to see the data displayed in a bar graph. I chose to sketch out three different options of bar graphs as I wasn't quite sure which one would be best to display the data. 

### Sketch 1
In the first sketch, I put the months along the x-axis and amount of people along the y-axis. I then grouped the bars for the four years of 2018-2021 and color coded them to show distinction. I made my sketch too big to fit on the page and could only fit eight months, but I think the idea is still there.

### Sketch 2
I was trying to play around with the best option to display the data while making the visual intuitive, communicative, visually appealing etc. In this sketch, I decided to group the graphs by each month, which each year along the x-axis. This created a total of 12 graphs. I also took out the color since there was so many graphs, I did not want to create any more chaos. After sketching these out, I immediately knew that there was too much on the page and viewers would not know what to look at first. The information would not be intuitive enough as viewers would have to look at each grpah in order to see the comparison, causing your eye to search all over the page.

### Sketch #3
In this graph, I decided to group the data by year, for a total of 12 graphs. I sketched the number of months along the x-axis and soon realized that by creating the visual in this manner, it was a great way to display the monthly data of each year. However, that is not quite the story that the graphs are supposed to represent. I also kept the visual colorless in order to eliminate business.
