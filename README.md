# About Me
I am a second year Master of Arts Management student here at CMU. I love to run run, swim, bike, hike, ski, play piano and spend time with my friends and family when I am not studying. When the pandemic initially began (after lockdowns were over), I decided to take up ice skating lessons as my pandemic activity. While I have not had time to continue with lessons due to my class schedule, I hope to start ice skating lessons again once I graduate. My favorite food is ice cream and I am always on the hunt for the best ice cream in Pittsburgh!


# What I hope to learn
How to create effective data visuals! I am excited to learn how I can incorporate what I learn in my future work as I plan on working in the classical music industry such as music festivals or symphony/orchestras. 


# Portfolio
Below is where you will find my work throughout the mini of this course. 


### Government Debt Visualization
Below is the visualization I created of the first assignment, where we had to use data on countries' level of debt. 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11721168"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


I then recreated this data set into a different visual that I thought would be more appropriate. 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11730255"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### Homework 3&4
The purpose of this assignment was to find a data visual that was not a good rendering of a data set. I then redesigned the data set into a visual that is easier to read and overall looks better than the original.
