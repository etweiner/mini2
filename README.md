# About Me
I am a second year Master of Arts Management student here at CMU. I love to run run, swim, bike, hike, ski, play piano and spend time with my friends and family when I am not studying. When the pandemic initially began (after lockdowns were over), I decided to take up ice skating lessons as my pandemic activity. While I have not had time to continue with lessons due to my class schedule, I hope to start ice skating lessons again once I graduate. My favorite food is ice cream and I am always on the hunt for the best ice cream in Pittsburgh!


# What I hope to learn
How to create effective data visuals! I am excited to learn how I can incorporate what I learn in my future work as I plan on working in the classical music industry such as music festivals or symphony/orchestras.
