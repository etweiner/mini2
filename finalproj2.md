## Data Visuals to go with the storyboard
### **Scene 2**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/12011897"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In the storyboard, I had originally drew that I wanted to display the amount of National Parks on a map. However, I ran into some trouble attempting to create a map in that I was unable to chucnk the data in a way where it populates the acres of National Park land in each state.
Instead, I created a treemap hierarchy of the total acreage of National Park Service lands next to how that land is divided up. The purpose is to set the stage of story by showing the audience just how vast the National Park Service (NPS) is and what their responsibilities entail much more than what the general public probably thinks. 


### **Scene 3**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11999289"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In scene 3, I want to show just how popular the national parks are by showing the monthly average tourist visitation. The audience can gather the peak times of year in which the parks are the busiest versus the off season. This can help avid park enthusiasts plan their trips if they would like to avoid more crowds while it also displays
the shear amount of people that flock to the parks. The years represented in this data have pretty consitant numbers of people as it is before the onset of Covid so the audience can compare what the National Parks were like before Covid changed a lot of aspects of the NPS.


### **Scene 4**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12000032"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In line with my storyboard, we are now at scene 4 in which the Covid pandemic has begun. This has drastically shifted the National Parks and we can see evidence of Covid's immediate impact based on the number of visitors of 2020 compared with the amount of visitors the year prior. I used a stacked line chart to emphasize the dramatic decrease in visitation to the National Parks.


### **Scene 5**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12000186"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In scene 5, Covid has subsided a little that people can resume some normal activities. Because of the emphasis on spending time outdoors,^1 many people travelled to different National Park lands, where average monthly visitation has increased again. However, the numbers are still not quite the same as 2019 for various reasons, which are explored in scene 6. 


### **Scene 6**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12011084"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

On average, the National Park Service employs about 20,000 employees each year. Many of the employees are permanent, however, the NPS relies on a good chunk of seasonal, temporary employees to work in Spring/Summer months when the parks have been the busiest (this is also displayed in the visitation data visuals).
In 2021, the NPS employed less than their 20,000 employee average which greatly affected the park's conditions and how they operated. Due to staffing shortages, many parks struggled to maintain their required maintenance, conservation and research efforts, educational programming, and ability to control the same amount of visitors that came to the parks prior to the pandemic. 
Covid played many factors in the staffing shortages as many staff were out sick and a lot of the parks rely on tourist income via park passes and gift shop purchases. Because the numbers were so low in 2020, the NPS did not earn as much income as the years prior, which could have also played a role in the staffing shortages. 

While the visual does not seem like there is a large decrease in NPS staff, if you think back to scene two, the NPS is responsible for over 85 million acres of designated National Park land and less than 20,000 personel is only a fraction of that coverage. 


### **Scene 7**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12011736"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Prior to 2020, the National Park Service would administer about 889 research permits each year.^2 In the year of 2020, the NPS issued only 331 permits. That is 37% of the normal permits issued.^3
These research permits are critical for the study and monitoring of our NPS system, education, ecology, environment and climate. Without these types of research, there are gaps in data collection and research projects.
These gaps in research can be detrimental to the way the National Parks are conserved and preserved and how the climate is affecting the health of our National Parks.^4
These research gaps can also lead to lack of education surrounding the parks because there is not the necessary information to properly inform the public on the happenings in the National Parks.


### **Scene 8 - Call to Action**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12013363"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The Covid19 pandemic greatly disrupted the US National Parks operations and management, in which the long term affects on conservation and preservation are still unknown. However, pepole who are interested in the National Parks have opportunities to learn more about the NPS. This visual dispalys the vast amount of educational resources available online, free to the public. 
Covid has taught us many things, but it also demonstrated how fragile our National Parks. In order to make sure the 
National Parks will be here for years to come, we must educate ourselves and take advantage of the free resources available to us all.
