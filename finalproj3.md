# Final Project Part 3
Final write up- what have I done to complete this project. 

## Refining my story
As I mentioned in Homework 3&4 and Part 1 of the final project, I love to visit national parks. In Homework 3&4, I recreated a data visualization on the visitation numbers to national parks pre and post-covid. 

After completing that assignment, I was curious as to why the tourist numbers to national parks had not reached the prior levels. It was clear to me that there were many factors that played a role, laregely due to the Covid19 pandemic. I decided I wanted to continue this research into the final project by researching the impacts of Covid19 on national parks.
I came across different articles and data sets, (in which the National Park Service is great at collecting) attributed to how national parks were impacted by Covid. 

In Part 1 of the project, I brainstormed how I wanted my story to develop, with the ideas of data sets that I wanted to use. In Part 2, I collected those data sets that are representative of Covid impacts on the National Parks. 
After drawing my storyboard, I created the actual visualizations to input into my final project. 

However, throughout the process, I felt as though my call to action, at the end, could be stronger. This was as I recieved my userfeedback not only from my interviews but from class members as well. 
I originally attempted to end my story by showing a great number of online educational resources that the NPS offers to the public, for free. My rational was that these free resources allows anyone to educate themselves on the parks as a result from Covid, as many things moved online. As I moved through the story, however, this last piece never really fit. In one of my interviews, the interviewee said that he just didn't understand that last piece and that it seemed pretty random because the rest of the story focused on Covid impacts and how national parks have suffered. He was right, as the story was not matching up from the begining to the end. 


I then discussed this problem with Chanaradee who helped me refine and work out my call to action from my story. From our conversation, the elements of my story became clear to me:
-The NPS maintains and manages over 85 M acres of land, 
-Before Covid, the parks saw, on average, over 300,000,000 people per year
-In 2020, the start of Covid, visitation dramatically dropped
-As the world opened up again in 2021, so did the National Parks but the visitation numbers had not reached the same as before Covid,
-Visitation was affected by staffing shortages in which not enough employees mean that they are unable to properly and adequately manage the parks and number of visitors it had once seen
-A shortage of employees also impacted the number of research permits administered in which research is valuable to maintaining, conserving and preserving the national parks
-Earned revenue from visitation was lost during Covid because the number of visitors were down, which greatly reduced the amount of funding the national parks recieve as visitation revenue is a source of funding
-Lack of funding means the NPS is unable to hire as many employees and grant research permits in order to support the parks. 

In all, I wanted to show my audience what happens when a serious situation, such as the pandemic, occurs and the National Parks are left to cope with the outcomes by themselves, where mulitiple different aspects of the park are impacted by Covid. I had all the pieces of the story, including more elements that did work, I just had to sort of reaarange them in order to get a flow. 

### Knowing My Audience
After discussing and formulating the above, I was able to clearly tell who my audience was- government officials. I previously had struggled with this aspect as, again, I thought I was initally tailoring my story to national park enthusiasts, like myself. However, as I was completing some background research on the data, I learned that Congress does allocate a budget for the National Parks, however, because the revenue from tourists decreased in 2020, the National Parks need additional funds. 

Once I could clearly labled my audience, I was able write out my call to action in which national parks need more funding to hire more employees in order to support the large amount of visitors and grant research permits in order to maintain, conserve and preserve the national parks for years to come. 

**OR: Call your congressmen/women to advocate for the parks to recieve more funding. These are an American gem......**

## Editing My Visuals
After recieving user feedback from my interviews and feedback from some of my classmates, I edited many of my graphics. First, I made sure all the colors were consistent, which many people commented on how the visuals should have the same color scheme throghout the story. Initially, I had thrown some green into some of my visuals because I thought it related well to the outdoor/park vibes, however, after hearing feedback, I went through each graphic and made sure the colors were the same throughout. I utlized red quite a bit so when I was showing comparisons, they could be noticed easily. 

In the second visual, depicting the drop in visitation due to Covid, it was suggested to create a stronger difference between the years. In this visual, I increased the color transparency so it was a solid color as Flourish will generate the graphs somewhat transparent. In a few other visuals, it was suggested to label the x-axis so it can help the audience see the labels clearer. Additionally, the biggest change I made was taking out the bar graph I had of all the online educational materials. As I discussed above, this segment did not make sense or was relevant to the story, so I eliminated it. Also, after Professor Goranson suggested that the bar graph that depicted the number of NPS employee through the years be a call out statistic instead of a visual. I took his advice and I think it presented a stronger message and it was easier for the audience to understand. 


## Shorthand
I really enjoyed working with Shorthand. I think it is a great way to present information, other than a powerpoint. One of the nice things about it is that it is linked to Unsplash, which had beautiful pictures of National Parks that I used in my project. In addition to telling a story about the impacts of Covid, I also wanted my audience to see just how beautiful these parks are, especially if some have never been. I feel as though they are hidden gems of the United States.
