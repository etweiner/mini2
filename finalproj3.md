# Final Project Part 3
Final write up- what have I done

## Refining my story
As I mentioned in Part 1 of the final project, I love to visit national parks. In Homework 3&4, I recreated a data visualization on the visitation numbers to national parks pre and post-covid. 
After completing that assignment, I was curious as to why the tourist numbers to national parks had not reached the prior levels. It was clear to me that there were many factors that played a role, laregely due to the Covid19 pandemic. I decided I wanted to continue this research into the final project by researching the impacts of Covid19 on national parks.
I came across different articles and data sets, (in which the National Park Service is great at collecting) attributed to how national parks were impacted by Covid. 

In Part 1 of the project, I brainstormed how I wanted my story to develop, with the ideas of data sets that I wanted to use. In Part 2, I collected those data sets that are representative of Covid impacts on the National Parks. 
After drawing my storyboard, I created the actual visualizations to input into my final project. 

However, throughout the process, I felt as though my call to action, at the end, could be stronger. This was as I recieved my userfeedback not only from my interviews but from class members as well. 
I originally attempted to end my story by showing all these online educational resources that the NPS offers to the public, for free. As I moved through the story, however, this last piece never really fit. One of my interviews said that he just didn't understand that last piece and that it seemed pretty random because the rest of the story focused on Covid impacts and how national parks have suffered. 
I then discussed this problem with [Chanadaree] SPELL who helped me refine and work out my call to action from my story, in which the elements are: 
-The NPS maintains and manages over 85 M acres of land, 
-Before Covid, the parks saw, on average, over 300,000,000 people per year
-In 2020, the start of Covid, visitation dramatically dropped
-As the world opened up again in 2021, so did the National Parks but the visitation numbers had not reached the same as before Covid,
-Visitation was affected by staffing shortages in which not enough employees mean that they are unable to properly and adequately manage the parks and number of visitors it had once seen
-A shortage of employees also impacted the number of research permits administered in which research is valuable to maintaining, conserving and preserving the national parks
-Earned revenue from visitation was lost during Covid because the number of visitors were down, which greatly reduced the amount of funding the national parks recieve as visitation revenue is a source of funding
-Lack of funding means the NPS is unable to hire as many employees and grant research permits in order to support the parks. 

After discussing and formulating the above, I was able to clearly tell who my audience was- government officials. I previously had struggled with this aspect as, again, I thought I was initally tailoring my story to national park enthusiasts, like myself. The NPS does recieve funding from Congress, in addition to their earned income from visitor revenue. 
Once I could clearly lable my audience, I was able write out my call to action in which national parks need more funding to hire more employees in order to support the large amount of visitors and grant research permits in order to maintain, conserve and preserve the national parks for years to come.
